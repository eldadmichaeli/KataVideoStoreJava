# Clean Code Workshop

## Workshop Steps

1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Numbers**
   - Replace magic numbers with named constants.

2. **Use Meaningful and Descriptive Names**
   - Choose clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

3. **Use Comments Sparingly, and When You Do, Make Them Meaningful**
   - Write comments that explain why something is done, not what is done.

4. **Write Short Functions That Only Do One Thing**
   - Ensure each function has a single responsibility.

5. **Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**
   - Avoid duplicating code or logic.

6. **Follow Established Code-Writing Standards**
   - Adhere to the coding standards agreed upon by your team.

7. **KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid**
   - Simplify your code as much as possible.

## Workshop Structure

- **Initial Task**: Youâ€™ll be given a piece of poorly written code. Implement everything you know, refactor, do not overcomplicate, and refactor again.
- **Testing**: Rerun tests to ensure you did not break the code.
- **Participation**: Mandatory for all attendees.

## Schedule

- **Total Length**: 2.5 hours
  - **Self Work Time**: 1.5 hours
  - **Conclusion and Live Refactoring**: 1 hour

## Group Work

- **Team Size**: 3-4 developers
- **Tools**: Use your favorite IDE.
- **Project**: Clone the project.
- **Branching**: Create a branch for your team and work ONLY on your team branch.

## Working Cycles

- **Cycle Duration**: 15 minutes
  - The 1st team member starts to refactor.
  - After 15 minutes, push the code to the branch.
  - The 2nd team member updates the branch and continues to work.
  - Repeat this process until the time ends.

## Monitoring

- **Progress Monitoring**: We will monitor your progress and join your room simultaneously.

## Conclusion

At the end of the workshop session, teams will gather to refactor the project together.

Happy coding!
